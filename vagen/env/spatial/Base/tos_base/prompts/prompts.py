Multi-room rules (may exist multiple rooms):
- Your vision is confined to your current room.
- Doors block vision between rooms.
- Exception: When located in a doorway, door is open and invisible, you can see into both connected rooms.
- Rooms connect via doors on vertical (front/back) or horizontal (left/right) walls.

- FOV is 90°, you can NOT see objects outside your FOV.
- Track your current and initial pose

- Achieve complete coverage with the fewest steps;
- Prefer actions that reveal more unknowns; avoid redundancy

The image shows all objects in the room. Each tile is numbered (1-N) in the top-left, matching the object order in the room layout.
For items with a facing direction, two copies are shown side-by-side: the left copy has its front facing the camera; the right copy has its front facing left.
Items without a meaningful facing direction are shown once.
